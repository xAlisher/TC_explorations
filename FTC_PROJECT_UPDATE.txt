🎉 Project Update: Keycard NDEF Writer Android App

We've successfully built an Android app that enables secure NFC communication with Status Keycard hardware wallets!

✅ What We Accomplished:
• Complete secure channel implementation using Keycard SDK v3.1.2
• PIN verification workflow
• NDEF writing to Keycard (profile URLs readable by NFC readers)
• Modern Android UI with Jetpack Compose

📱 User Flow:
1. Enter Keycard PIN → Verify via NFC
2. Enter Funding The Commons profile ID
3. Tap card → Write profile URL to Keycard
4. Profile accessible via any NFC reader

🔐 Security:
- Full pairing and encrypted secure channel
- Hardware wallet protection
- Secure PIN authentication

📂 Open Source: https://github.com/xAlisher/TC_explorations

🚀 Next Steps:
- Signing data with Keycard private keys
- Verifiable Credentials support

This enables users to carry their FtC profile on their Keycard, accessible via NFC while maintaining hardware wallet security.
